# Toys4U
Toys4U Project - IMAT2204 Project Management and Development

Creating a web application hosted on Azure as part of a group.
Individually, we created our own sections which included CRUD functionality as well as integrating a front, middle and back layer.
In the development process, we used TDD to ensure our code was working through every step of the process.
